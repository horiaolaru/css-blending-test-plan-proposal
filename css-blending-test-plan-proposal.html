				This document is intended to be used as a guideline for the testing
				activities related to the Compositing and Blending spec [[!compositing-1]]. Its main
				goal is to provide an overview of the general testing areas and an informative
				description of possible test cases.
			</p>
			<p>
				This document is not meant to replace the spec in determining the
				normative and non-normative assertions to be tested, but rather
				complement it.
			</p>
		</section>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>

			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Goals</h2>
			<section>
				<h3>Providing guidance on testing</h3>
				<p>
					In order to increase the quality of the test contributions, this
					document offers a set of test cases description for conducting testing (see
					<a href="#test-cases-description" class="sectionRef"></a>).
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Creating automation-friendly tests</h3>
				<p>
					In terms of actual tests produced for the CSS Compositing and Blending, the main goal
					is to ensure that most tests are automatable (i.e. they're either
					reftests or use <code>testharness.js</code>). Even where manual tests
					are absolutely necessary they should be written so that they can be
					easily automated &ndash; as there are on-going efforts to make
					WebDriver [[webdriver]] automated tests a first class citizen in W3C
					testing. This means that even if a manual test requires user
					interaction, the validation or PASS/FAIL conditions should still be
					clear enough as to allow automatic validation if said interaction is
					later automated.
				</p>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Approach</h2>
			<p>
				Since CSS blending has only three new CSS properties,
				the approach is to deep dive into every aspect of the spec as much as possible.

				Tests will be created for the testing areas listed in <a href="#testig-areas" class="sectionRef"></a>
				and having as guidance the test cases description from <a href="#test-cases-description" class="sectionRef"></a>.

			<h2>Testing areas</h2>
			<section>
				<h3>Explicit testing areas</h3>
				    <p>
			          These testing areas cover things explicitly defined in the normative sections of the Blending and Compositing spec. Please note that while detailed, this list is not necessarily
			          exhaustive and some normative behaviors may not be contained in it.
			          When in doubt, consult the Blending and Compositing spec or ask a question on the
			          <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/">mailing
			          list</a>.
			        </p>
				<p>Below is the list of explicit testing areas:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Proper parsing of the CSS properties and rendering according to the spec
						<ul><code>mix-blend-mode</code></ul>
						<ul><code>isolation</code></ul>
						<ul><code>background-blend-mode</code></ul>
					</li>
					<li>SVG blending</li>
					<li>Canvas 2D blending</li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Implicit testing areas</h3>
		        <p>
		          These are testing areas either normatively defined in other specs
		          that explicitly refer to the Blending and Compositing spec (e.g. [[!css3-transforms]])
		          or simply not explicitly defined, but implied by various aspects of
		          the spec (e.g. processing model, CSS 2.1 compliance, etc.).
		          Please note that while detailed, this list is not necessarily
		          exhaustive and some normative behaviors may not be contained in it.
		          When in doubt, consult the Blending and Compositing spec or ask a question on the
		          <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/">mailing
		          list</a>.
		        </p>
				<p>Below is the list of implicit testing areas:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Blending different types of elements
						<ul>
							<li><code>&lt;video&gt;</code></li>
							<li><code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code></li>
							<li><code>&lt;table&gt;</code></li>
							</ul>
					</li>
                    <li>Blending elements with specific style rules applied
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>transforms</code></li>
                            <li><code>transitions</code> </li>
                            <li><code>animations</code> </li>
                        </ul>

				<h2>Test cases description</h2>
				<section>
					<h3>Test cases for <code>mix-blend-mode</code></h3>
					<p>
						The following diagram describes a list of notations to be used later on in the document as well as the general document structure the test cases will follow. The test cases should not be limited to this structure. This should be a wireframe and people are encouraged to come up with complex test cases as well.
					</p>
					<p>
						<img id="test_outline" src="test_template.png" alt="Mix-blend-mode sample elements">
					</p>
					<p>The intended structure of the document is the following:</p>
						<pre>
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div id="[P]"&gt;
        &lt;div id="[IN-S]"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div id="[IN-P]"&gt;
            &lt;div id="[B]"&gt;
                &lt;div id="[CB]"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
         &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
						</pre>
                    <p> Unless otherwise stated, test cases asumes the following properties for the elements: <br>
                        <ul>
                        <li> default value for the <code>background-color</code> of the <code>body</code></li>
                        <li> <code>background-color</code> set to a fully opaque color for all the other elements </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>The CSS associated to the elements used in the tests shouldn't use properties that creates a stacking context, except the ones specified in the test case descriptions.</p>
                    <p>Every test case has a description of the elements used. The notation from the image is used in the test case description too (e.g. for parent element the notation is [P]). Each test case uses only a subset of the elements while the other elements should just be removed.
                    </p></p>
