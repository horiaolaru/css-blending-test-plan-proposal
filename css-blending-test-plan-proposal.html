      <p>
        This document is intended to be used as a guideline for the testing
        activities related to the CSS Blending spec [[!compositing-1]]. Its main
        goal is to provide an overview of the general testing areas and an informative
        description of possible test cases.
      </p>
      <p>
        This document is not meant to replace the spec in determining the 
        normative and non-normative assertions to be tested, but rather
        complement it.
      </p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>

      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>
        To ensure a comprehensive test suite with useful, high quality tests, a
        number of goals are proposed. They range from process goals (how to
        conduct testing) to implementation goals (how to write good tests).
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Providing guidance on testing</h3>
        <p>
          In order to increase the quality of the test contributions, this
          document offers a set of test cases description for conducting testing (see
          <a href="#test-cases-description" class="sectionRef"></a>).
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Creating automation-friendly tests</h3>
        <p>
          In terms of actual tests produced for the CSS Blending, the main goal
          is to ensure that most tests are automatable (i.e. they're either
          reftests or use <code>testharness.js</code>). Even where manual tests
          are absolutely necessary they should be written so that they can be
          easily automated &ndash; as there are on-going efforts to make
          WebDriver [[webdriver]] automated tests a first class citized in W3C
          testing. This means that even if a manual test requires user
          interaction, the validation or PASS/FAIL conditions should still be
          clear enough as to allow automatic validation if said interaction is
          later automated.
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Approach</h2>
      <p>
        Since CSS blending has only a few sets of CSS properties,
        the approach is to deep dive every aspect of the spec as much as possible.

        Tests will be created for the testing areas listed in <a href="#testig-areas" class="sectionRef"></a> 
        and having as guidance the test cases description from <a href="#test-cases-description" class="sectionRef"></a>.

          <p>Every test case has a description of the elements used. The notation from the image is used in the testcase description too(e.g. For parent element the notation is [P]) </p>
